HomeTap : Demonstration Project
Thomas Brewer
Note: This is a simple project in preparation for my interview with HomeTap. The purpose is not to show a complex analysis, but rather demonstrate some of the skills .up my sleeve (and asked for in the job listing), and emphasize my motivation for this position. 

You will also find the same on my github : https://github.com/t-brewer
Objective : Make simple model to estimate house prices based on features.
For this I use the San Luis Obipso houses dataset (https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/datasets/wiki/Houses). I would have used some from the Boston area, but I was having trouble finding a free dataset, beyond the Boston Housing Dataset typically used in intro to machine learning courses.
The dataset used has some very basic properties :
MLS: Multiple listing service number for the house (unique ID).
Location: city/town where the house is located. Most locations are in San Luis Obispo county and northern Santa Barbara county (Santa Maria-Orcutt, Lompoc, Guadelupe, Los Alamos), but there some out of area locations as well.
Price: the most recent listing price of the house (in dollars).
Bedrooms: number of bedrooms.
Bathrooms: number of bathrooms.
Size: size of the house in square feet.
Price/SQ.ft: price of the house per square foot.
Status: type of sale. Thee types are represented in the dataset: Short Sale, Foreclosure and Regular. 

This preparation should demonstrate:
Data Manipulation (via pandas)
Exploratory Data Analysis / Statistics
Visualizations
Sci-Kit Learn
Machine Learning
Web scraping (not asked for, but thought I would include it anyway since it could be a useful skill when dealing with real estate (get some extra info about basically anything))
